      "A manufactured home in Idaho is one of two legally different things, and which one it is decides almost everything about selling it: whether you transfer a title or a deed, who will lend against it, how it is taxed, and whether it can be moved at all.",

Under Idaho Code 63-304 a manufactured home may constitute real property only if the running gear is removed AND it becomes permanently affixed to a foundation on land the owner owns or is buying — or leases under qualifying financing — AND the owner records a statement of intent to declare it real property with the county recorder.",

Financing is the practical difference between the two states: a home that is personal property is chattel, and the lending available against chattel is a different and generally worse market than mortgage lending. A buyer's ability to finance is a seller's problem as much as a buyer's.",
          "Assessment is a separate question from legal character, and the two are easy to conflate. Idaho requires manufactured homes to be assessed as other residential housing with the assessment entered on the property roll — but that is a rule about how value is worked out, not a statement that the home is real property.

Physical removal is then prohibited without the consent of every person or entity holding an interest in the real property or title to any estate in it — and to find out who that is, the homeowner must obtain a title report from a title insurance company.
